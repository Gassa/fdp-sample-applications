# FDP Sample Applications

Contains sample applications for Lightbend Fast Data Platform (FDP).

> **Disclaimer:** These sample applications are provided as-is, without warranty. They are intended to illustrate techniques for implementing various scenarios using Fast Data Platform, but they have not gone through a robust validation process, nor do they use all the techniques commonly employed for highly-resilient, production applications. Please use them with appropriate caution.

The applications are organized in subdirectories. For details, see the corresponding READMEs:

## A note about versioning

Don't put a `version := ...` setting in your sub-project because versioning is completely
controlled by [`sbt-dynver`](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver) and enforced by the `Enforcer` plugin found in the `build-plugin`
directory.
